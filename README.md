#Â How to Use:
Save the Script: Ensure your script (e.g., event_blocker.lua) is in the same directory as the fxmanifest.lua.
Resource Directory: Place the directory containing both the script and the fxmanifest.lua in your server's resources directory.
Start the Resource: Add start <resource-name> in your server.cfg file, replacing <resource-name> with the name of your resource directory.
